            A few hundred kilometers away from Aizawl lies Lunglei, one of the top places to visit in Northeast India. This is a town that not only boasts of panoramic vistas but old churches and relics of British missionaries.  The wildlife sanctuaries in Lunglei are home to diverse flora and fauna. 
            It’s a popular holiday destination for birdwatchers too.

            The capital city of Mizoram, Aizawl attracts Indian and international tourists alike. This 124-year old city has rich cultural heritage and is well-known for its scenic beauty and elevated setting. Aizawl is favored by solo travelers as well as families. It is also a popular trekking destination in Northeast India. One of the things that sets Aizawl apart from other holiday destinations is the quiet in the air. 
            Though there are cars on the road, you’ll have to strain your ears to hear them honk.

            Tamdil: Literally -lake of mustard -, Tamdil is situated near Saitual village, about 110 km from Aizawl. Having been developed as an important pisciculture center by the Fisheries Department and a holiday resort by the Tourism Department, this is perhaps the most frequented lake in the state. The lake and the surrounding thick forest are home to wide species of trees, plants, and animals According to folklore, a couple used to have a jhum cultivation in this small valley surrounded by hills but the man died suddenly and left the woman to look after the crops alone. In the middle of the field, there was a mustard plant that was bigger than the others and one night the widow was told in her dreams by her dead husband to take special care of the mustard plant which would bring her great blessings. So she did as she was told, giving special attention to the plant and watering it daily, and indeed it thrived very well and grew bigger and bigger. After some time, the widow remarried but her new husband did not like her to keep anything that would remind her of her former husband so he pulled the plant up by the roots and threw it away. Out of the hole thus left in the
             ground water spouted immediately and after a while, 
             it filled the small valley to become a large lake.
