            Once part of the ancient Silk Road, the 14,450 ft. high Nathula Pass is a popular tourist spot. A few hours’ drive east of Gangtok, Nathula Pass offers tourists a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of city life. Hire a cab and drive down the road towards the pass, often called one of the scariest roads in India, to enjoy the beauty of this hillside and catch a glimpse of the Chinese side of the border. 
            Regardless of the time of year you visit, this is one place you’ll always see some snow.

            Also known as the Changu Lake, the Tsomgo Lake presents an ethereal view of rugged mountains. The lake stands at an altitude of 12,400 ft. and looks different around the year. In the late spring, the lakeside is covered with flowers in full bloom while in winter, it freezes solid. There are a number of legends and myths associated with this lake that are significant for Buddhist monks and Sikkim’s faith healers. For tourists, a yak ride is a moment to remember. 
            In the winter, you can even take a yak ride on the frozen lake.

            When it comes to trekking routes, there’s nothing quite like Goechala. This 10-12 day trek offers a glimpse of 14 Himalayan summits including Mt. Kanchenjunga. From the gushing Teesta River, the Paha Khola Bridge and Viburnum plantations to the rhododendron forests of Phedang, this is one of the most beautiful treks you will ever embark on. 
            It’s not hard to understand why this is one of the top places to visit in Northeast India.
